# Add Citations to Support Claims

**Ground AI output in verifiable real-world sources for credibility and validation.**

---

## üéØ The Complete Prompt

```markdown
Add 2 verifiable citations or repository links supporting each section.

{{content_to_enhance}}

For each major claim or recommendation:
1. Identify authoritative sources ({{source_types}})
2. Add inline citations with links
3. Include a References section at the end
4. Verify all links are accessible

Format citations as:
- [Source Name](URL) - Brief description of relevance
```

## üìã When to Use

**Apply this prompt when:**
- ‚úÖ Output makes technical claims that should be verified
- ‚úÖ Creating documentation for public consumption
- ‚úÖ Need to increase credibility of recommendations
- ‚úÖ Want readers to explore sources themselves
- ‚úÖ Building educational or tutorial content
- ‚úÖ Refactoring AI output to add sources

**Document types that benefit:**
- Technical guides

## üîß Usage Examples

### Example 1: Add Citations to Previous Response

**Input:**
```markdown
Add 2 verifiable citations or repository links supporting each section.

{Use the previous response}

For each major claim or recommendation:
1. Identify authoritative sources (GitHub repos, official docs, MDN)
2. Add inline citations with links
3. Include a References section at the end
4. Verify all links are accessible
```

**Result:** Previous response enhanced with inline citations and references section.

---

### Example 2: Enhance Existing Documentation

**Input:**
```markdown
Add 2 verifiable citations or repository links supporting each section.

## React Best Practices

1. Use functional components with hooks
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Optimize with React.memo for expensive renders
4. Use Suspense for code splitting

For each major claim or recommendation:
1. Identify authoritative sources (GitHub repos, React docs, research papers)
2. Add inline citations with links
3. Include a References section at the end
4. Verify all links are accessible
```

**Result:** Each best practice backed by React docs, popular GitHub repos, and performance studies.

---

### Example 3: Academic-Style Citations

**Input:**
```markdown
Add 2 verifiable citations or repository links supporting each section.

{content about OAuth security}

For each major claim or recommendation:
1. Identify authoritative sources (RFCs, OWASP, security research papers)
2. Add inline citations with links
3. Include a References section at the end
4. Verify all links are accessible

Format citations as:
- [Source Name](URL) - Brief description of relevance
```

**Result:** Security claims backed by RFCs, OWASP guidelines, and security research.

---

## ‚úÖ Quality Indicators

**Good citations include:**
- Direct links to authoritative sources
- Brief description of relevance
- Mix of official docs, repos, and research
- Accessible URLs (not behind paywalls when possible)
- Recent sources (especially for fast-moving tech)

**Red flags:**
- Generic citations that don't support specific claims
- Broken or inaccessible links
- Only one type of source (e.g., all blog posts)
- Citations without context or description
- Sources that contradict the claim

---

## üéØ Source Type Recommendations

### For Code Patterns
**Best sources:**
- Official framework documentation
- Popular GitHub repositories with high stars
- Framework maintainer blogs
- Stack Overflow canonical questions

### For Architecture Decisions
**Best sources:**
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- System design books/papers
- Tech company engineering blogs
- Academic research papers

### For Security Claims
**Best sources:**
- RFCs and standards (IETF, W3C)
- OWASP guidelines
- CVE databases
- Security research papers

### For Performance Optimization
**Best sources:**
- Benchmark repos
- Browser vendor documentation
- Performance measurement studies
- Framework performance guides

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Mix Source Types
Combine official docs + real-world examples + research for strongest validation.

### 2. Prefer Primary Sources
Link to original documentation rather than tutorials about it.

### 3. Check Link Stability
Prefer permalink URLs (with commit SHAs for GitHub) over branch references.

### 4. Add Context
Don't just list links - explain why each source is relevant.

### 5. Update Regularly
Check citations periodically for dead links or outdated information.
